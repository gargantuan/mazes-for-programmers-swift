# Mazes for programmers
## Examples in Swift

[Mazes for Programmers (Pragmatic Bookshelf)](https://pragprog.com/book/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers) is a fantastic book and an even better resource. The examples in the book are written in Ruby. As I work through the examples, I'll be porting them to Swift. It's not quite as elegant or concise a ruby, but a great way to get familiar with the langauge.
